Performance Bugs: [ Paper : Lightweight, High-Resolution Monitoring
for Troubleshooting Production Systems ]
1. Busy Loop:
	High CPU utilization (cpuu) with a low
(nearly-zero) L2-cache-miss rate (l2mi) is a symptom of
a busy loop; i.e., a loop that is unproductive but that does
not yield the CPU to the scheduler. This is because processes
in busy loops consume CPU resources but do not
generate much memory traffic. The value of l2mi gives
a rough approximation of memory traffic, and when it is
seen to be low with a high cpuu, it usually amounts to a
busy loop.

2. Memory Leak:
	An increase in the net (user or kernel) memory
allocated is an indicator of a memory leak.

3. lock, i/o, sock contention:
	When the resource blocking vital (blck) for 
a process is high, then it is typically mirrored by one
or more of the following vitals: disk I/O (blio), locking
(lock) or socket traffic (sock), thereby isolating the source
of the blockage.

4. 
	: When the combined value of cpuu for processes
is low, scheduling delay (sched) is high, and the
total cpuu is high for the system, it is often a sign of a
kernel bottleneck (e.g., a high-priority kernel thread). In
this case, processes are not scheduled because the scheduler
is not given a chance to run. This rule also applies to
preemptable kernels, with the caveat that the symptoms
are less conspicuous.

from paper refs : 24 [ADP: Automated Diagnosis of Performance Pathologies Using Hardware Events]
1. Correlation based feature selection

2. Random forest+voting
	- doesnt overfit as it can have  mulitple decision trees

3. divide with no of cycles(not number of inst) to normalize

4. Ineffient/strided pointer/array access in parsec - canneal, streamcluster and fluidanimate( see the paper)
